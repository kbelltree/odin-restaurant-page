## Summary

This project is a desktop-browser-based restaurant website built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The main objectives include demonstrating knowledge of npm, JavaScript ES6 modules, and website development with webpack. 

For detailed lessons on these concepts, visit [The Odin Project - Project: Restaurant Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page).

## Key Project Instructions:

- The website should consist of three pages: Home, Menu, and Contact.
- Only the `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<div id="content">` tags should be present in index.html.
- All content must be dynamically created using JavaScript inside a `<div>`, which is then appended to `<div id="content">`.
- Create a module for each page, a style sheet, and an index.js as the entry point.
- The index.js should contain eventListeners that clear the content and reload the respective page upon clicking its tab.
